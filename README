This package adds bindings to the plugins system of XChat to Haskell.

Only 2.8.8 version of XChat is supported.
It builds some programe called hsxchat you can use to build
your plugins.

It is developped on a GNU/LINUX system,
 so don't expect it to work under Windows
 (although it should be quite easy to port).

It is yet experimental, only the example given in
 the examples (AutoOp and CountDown) are known to work.

I think all other features should also work,
 but there may be memory leaks, or performance issues.

If you have patches to repair some bug or improve the design
 as well as some test files, I will be glad to have them
 (se?drikov@gm?ail.com without the question marks),
 but please don't send feature request or complains,
 since the code is not yet mature.

Welcomed tests files are:
 plugins which should compile but don't
 plugins which leaks memory but shouldn't
 plugins which results in a segfault
 plugins which behave correctly (for regression tests)

If your test is split in many files,
 please send a single archive file (for example a *.tgz)

Yet I didn't even spent time to add strictness annotations
 or to hunt memory leaks due to my lack of relevant examples.
